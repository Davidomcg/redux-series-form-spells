  "description": "<p><strong>Unleash the Beast Within – Redux Series: Form Spells</strong></p><p>Battle forms in Pathfinder 2e are powerful tools within a spellcaster's kit but what if they could be more fleshed out and even a little bit more powerful? What if, when a druid enters its untamed form, it can charge forward or Strike a creature in the midst of their transformation? What if you can rise up from the ashes of your death when in the form of a Phoenix? What if your favourite form could be heightened to rank 10?</p><p><strong>Redux Series: Form Spells</strong> reimagines battle form spells with modified math for each of the player core 1 &amp; 2 spells, with various sub forms having different sizes and their own special abilities. Every spell now heightens all the way to rank 10 and some even allowing you to cast spells!</p><p>All this plus new feats, focus spells and a rework for the Untamed Druid order so it can work seamlessly with all these changes. Do you wish to scare your enemies with a frightening roar as a Tyrannosaur or crush a creature in your coils as a Serpent? Now you can.</p><p>Nature is scary. Your battle forms should be too.</p>",
